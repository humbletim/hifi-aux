Adds Tools -> User Scripts menu for quickly referencing community script utilities.

See this gist's [userscripts.json](#file-userscripts-js) for menu items.

At some point thinking to make contributor-maintainable by either:

* moving to a githug repo and accepting pull requests (but that would still require me to maintain)
* using a forum thread and 'scraping' it dynamically to extract menu item JSONs (so people could just update a Reply comment if changing their script URLs etc.)
