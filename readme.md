Adds Tools -> User Scripts menu for quickly referencing community script utilities.

See this gist's [usermods.json](#file-usermods-js) for menu items.

At some point thinking to make contributor-maintainable either:

* moving to a githug repo and accepting pull requests (but that requires me to maintain)
* using a forum thread and scraping it dynamically to extract menu item JSONs (so people could just update a Reply comment if changing their script URLs etc.)
